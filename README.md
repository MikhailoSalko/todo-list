The ToDo list project is a web application developed using React. 
The project utilizes React Bootstrap, a library that provides pre-designed components 
and styles for React applications, for a visually appealing and responsive design. 
Additionally, Redux, a state management library, has been integrated into the project 
to efficiently manage the application's state.

With the combination of React, React Bootstrap, and Redux, the ToDo list project offers 
users a seamless and interactive task management experience. 
Users can create, update, and delete tasks while enjoying a smooth and intuitive user interface. 
React provides the foundation for building dynamic components, React Bootstrap enhances 
the visual presentation, and Redux ensures a consistent and organized state management system.

By leveraging these technologies, the ToDo list project delivers a user-friendly task 
management solution that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and highly responsive.
